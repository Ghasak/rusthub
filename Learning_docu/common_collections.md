# Common Collections

Basically we have:
1. a `vector` allows you to store a varaible number of values next to each
   other.
2. a  `String`  is a collection of characters. We've mentioned the `String`
   type previously, but this chapter will talke about it in depth.
3. a `has-map` allow you to associate a value with a particule key. It's a
   particular implmentation of the more general data structure called a map.
